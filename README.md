This is a repo for testing various approaches on how to solve the wave simulation on Vertex Shader
Requirment:
 * Using vertex shader create a water like simulation on a grid plane
 * Several waves can be generated at the same time

 There are 2 parts of the project:
  * Example - this is created on geometry level and it will be used just as a reference. We need to copy the functionality exactly (except the waves will not bounce back in our case)
  * app - is a failed attempt to solve this issue and can be used as a starting point
